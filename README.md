# Text-mining-and-tuning-hyperparameter-for-classification-task

This project aims to explore and maximize the performance of text classification models through text mining and hyperparameter tuning. I use two main machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest, then for text representation I use the TF-IDF and Bag of Words (BoW) vectorization methods. The best accuracy results I achieved. With a combination of TF-IDF and linear kernel SVM, I achieved 96% accuracy in classifying text data. The project also provides detailed comparisons between various model combinations to outline their advantages and disadvantages. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to carry out text exploration, model optimization, and performance analysis with systematic and in-depth methods.
